# TSR
Traffic-Sign Recognition based on computer vision processing and deep-learning usign CNN.

The datasets used are: the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and the Belgium Traffic Sign Dataset (BTSD).

In order to run the project you will need to have Python 3.9 installed with all the modules included at the top of the main.py file. You will run the project using the command 'python3.9 main.py', which will return the accuracy for each epoch of the CNN built model for the GTSRB dataset.
