# TSR
Traffic-Sign Recognition based on computer vision processing and deep-learning using CNN.

The datasets used are:

* for detection: the German Trafic Sign Detection Benchmark (GTSDB);

* for recognition: the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and the Belgium Traffic Sign Dataset (BTSC).

In order to run the project you will need to have Python 3.9 installed with all the modules included at the top of the each *.py file. You will run the project using the command 'python3.9 *.py'.

Currently the project is divided into 2 parts:

* detection.py file, which will return the detected traffic sign regions of an input image;

* recognition.py file, which will return the accuracy for each epoch of the CNN built model for the GTSRB dataset.
